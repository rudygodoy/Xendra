/**
 * A TransferHandler that creates dynamic file lists during a drag and drop action.
 * Due to the design of the current DnD support in Swing, if the DataFlavor is
 * a @link java.awt.datatransfer.DataFlavor#javaFileListFlavor then the files must
 * exist locally before the DnD can start. This makes it hard to create the files
 * dynamically after the DnD has completed. This class tries to counter the
 * fact that the files must exist locally. This TransferHandler creates only the
 * files if the DnD action has started and/or is dragged on other components that
 * support the java file list data flavor.
 * <p>
 * This class uses the @link org.frappucino.swing.DynamicFileFactory to create
 * the actual files from the source component. The files are later removed when
 * the DnD action has been completed.
 * <p>
 * There are two different ways of creating the files through this TransferHandler
 * <ul>
 * <li> EARLY_GENERATION - The file is created when the DnD action is started, ie when the createTransferable()
 * method is called. This will create the file during the whole DnD action, so when the
 * mouse moves over a Component that supports the DataFlavor, the files are already
 * created, thus saving time.
 * <li> LATE_GENERATION - The file is created when the DnD action moves over a component
 * that supports the DataFlavor, ie most of the time the native file storage. The file is
 * created in the getTransferData() method in the DynamicFileTransferable class. This is
 * the last occasion that the file must exists. This will try to minimize the chance
 * that the files are created.
 * </ul>
